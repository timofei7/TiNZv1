ENGS 31 - Summer 2009
Final Project

[Video Demo](http://www.youtube.com/embed/jcJoUI1PBZo?rel=0&amp;hd=1)

Our goal for this project was to create a simple, but addicting game that played off of old-fashioned handheld and vintage arcade games, but utilized newer technology that allowed for a more modern feel and the implementation of more exciting features. This is a reinvention of the original tilt-maze game as a digital moving maze on an RBG 8x8 LED matrix controlled via accelerometer.  It takes the tilt as input to move the player on the board.  There is seven-segment display showing the timer and score. A piezo is also included to produce different sounds for specific actions in the game. These components contribute to a gaming experience that is stimulating both tactilely, visually and aurally. The game design also makes the game easy to reprogram to include more levels and additional features.  The included maze designs include a multicolor fire-spewing dragon, a volcano, and an alien space ship with lasers.
